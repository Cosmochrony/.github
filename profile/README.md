**Cosmochrony** is a pre-geometric theoretical framework in which time ordering, spacetime geometry, dynamics, and matter emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single relational substrate, χ.

In this framework:

- time corresponds to the intrinsic, directed relaxation (ordering) of χ,
- spacetime geometry emerges as an effective, continuum encoding of microscopic relational connectivity, valid only in projectable regimes,
- physical observables arise through a generally non-injective projection from χ to effective spacetime observables (χ_eff), limiting reconstruction of underlying configurations,
- particles correspond to stable, localized configurations characterized by spectral stability and topological constraints,
- electric charge is interpreted as a chiral–torsional invariant of relaxation fluxes,
- gravitation emerges from sustained constraints on χ relaxation and is recovered as an effective geometric limit,
- quantum-like phenomena arise from projection structure, stability spectra, and non-factorizable regimes, without invoking fundamental nonlocality,
- cosmological expansion and strong-gravity regimes follow from the same bounded relaxation dynamics, including saturation and deprojection effects.

The dynamical law and the effective Born–Infeld-like action are derived ab initio from structural constraints and causal saturation of relaxation fluxes; they constitute auxiliary effective encodings rather than fundamental postulates.

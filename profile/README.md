**Cosmochrony** is a pre-geometric theoretical framework in which time ordering, spacetime geometry, dynamics, and matter emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a single relational substrate, χ.

In this framework:

– time corresponds to the intrinsic, directed relaxation (ordering) of χ,
– spacetime geometry emerges as an effective, continuum encoding of microscopic relational connectivity,
– physical observables arise through a generally non-injective projection from χ to an effective spacetime descriptor χ_eff,
– particles correspond to stable, localized configurations characterized by spectral stability signatures,
– gravitation emerges from sustained constraints on χ relaxation, recovered as an effective geometric limit,
– quantum-like phenomena arise from projection structure, stability spectra, and non-factorizable regimes, without fundamental nonlocality,
– cosmological expansion and strong-gravity regimes follow from the same underlying relaxation dynamics.

The dynamical law and the effective Born–Infeld-like action are derived ab initio from structural constraints and causal saturation of relaxation fluxes.

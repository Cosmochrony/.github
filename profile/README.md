**Cosmochrony** is a foundational pre-geometric framework in which time ordering,
spacetime geometry, dynamics, and matter emerge from the irreversible relaxation
of a single relational substrate, denoted χ.

The framework is built on a minimal ontological assumption: no fundamental spacetime,
no metric, no fields, and no quantization postulates are introduced a priori.
Instead, familiar physical structures arise as regime-dependent effective descriptions,
obtained through a generally non-injective projection from χ to observable quantities
(χ_eff).

Core principles and results:

- **Time is emergent**  
  Physical time corresponds to the intrinsic, directed ordering of χ relaxation,
  not to an external parameter or coordinate.

- **Spacetime is an effective description**  
  Geometry arises as a continuum encoding of relational correlations in χ,
  valid only in projectable regimes and recovered as an operational limit.

- **Non-injective projection is fundamental**  
  Multiple underlying χ-configurations may correspond to identical observables,
  while a single configuration may admit several correlated effective realizations.
  This structural information loss under projection underlies quantum indeterminacy,
  contextuality, and Bell inequality violations without invoking fundamental nonlocality.

- **Bounded relaxation and Born–Infeld emergence**  
  Universal bounds on χ relaxation flux lead uniquely to a Born–Infeld-like effective
  action, providing non-singular dynamics, causal saturation, and a unified treatment
  of strong-field and high-energy regimes.

- **Matter and charge as structural invariants**  
  Particles correspond to stable, localized configurations characterized by spectral
  stability and topological constraints. Electric charge emerges as a chiral–torsional
  invariant of relaxation fluxes, without fundamental gauge fields.

- **Gravitation as inhibited relaxation**  
  Gravity arises from sustained constraints on χ relaxation ordering and is recovered
  as an effective geometric limit, reproducing the Schwarzschild solution and
  standard weak-field phenomenology.

- **Quantum phenomena without fundamental randomness**  
  Quantum correlations, entanglement, and Bell violations arise from the structure
  of projection and non-factorizable regimes, while classical behavior is recovered
  when the effective mapping becomes approximately injective.

- **Cosmology from the same dynamics**  
  Cosmological expansion, horizon structure, and strong-gravity regimes follow from
  bounded relaxation and projective compensation, without fundamental dark energy.
  The framework provides a structural explanation of the Hubble tension and flat
  galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter particles.

The effective dynamical laws, thermodynamic quantities, and geometric structures
are not fundamental postulates but compensatory encodings of unresolved relational
structure in projected descriptions.

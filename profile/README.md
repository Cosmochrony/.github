# Cosmochrony

**Cosmochrony** is an exploratory theoretical framework proposing a minimalist and geometric
origin for **time, spacetime, gravitation, quantum phenomena, and cosmological expansion**.

The central idea is that these phenomena emerge from the **irreversible relaxation of a single
continuous scalar field**, denoted **χ (chi)**, rather than being introduced as independent
fundamental ingredients.

## Core Idea

Cosmochrony is built on three key hypotheses:

1. **Time is not fundamental**  
   Time corresponds to the **monotonic, irreversible relaxation** of a scalar geometric quantity χ.

2. **Space is emergent**  
   Spatial separation arises from **relational differences and gradients of χ** once a stable
   geometric regime is reached.

3. **Matter and forces are emergent structures**  
   Particles are **stable topological excitations (solitons)** of χ.  
   Gravitation, quantum behavior, and radiation arise as **collective or effective phenomena**.

In this view:
- spacetime is not a background,
- quantization is not fundamental,
- cosmic expansion is not driven by dark energy.

## The χ Field

- χ is a **real scalar geometric field**
- it is **not defined on spacetime** — spacetime emerges from it
- its evolution is **globally monotonic**
- its local relaxation speed is bounded by **c**, identified with the speed of light

A minimal kinematic constraint governs its evolution:

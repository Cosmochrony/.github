**Cosmochrony** is an exploratory theoretical framework in which **time, spacetime, gravitation,
quantum phenomena, and cosmological expansion** emerge from the irreversible relaxation of a
single scalar geometric field, **χ**.

In this approach:
- time corresponds to the monotonic evolution of χ,
- space emerges from relational χ differences,
- particles are stable topological excitations (solitons),
- gravity arises from local slowing of χ relaxation,
- quantum behavior and entanglement emerge without fundamental nonlocality,
- cosmic expansion follows from the same dynamics, without dark energy.
